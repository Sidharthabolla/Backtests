
# QuantConnect PHP test

### Objectives
 
This test is designed to understand the candidate's ability to design and
implement a solution following object oriented programming in an MVC architecture.
 
### Instructions

We want to compare two backtesting results (`result1.json` and `result2.json`) 
these results are located at the root folder path. Each result contains multiple chart series,
but we are interested in displaying the **Strategy Equity** to compare the overall
performance of each strategy. To do this we have designed a simple view page
(`sparkline.php`) that displays two sparklines one on top of the other.

Your goal is to create/extend the models, views, and controllers that will allow you
to build the array of values for each of the sparklines. Due to a library limitation
both arrays must have a length of 100 points. We use PHP 7.1 and we are going to consider bonus 
points on solutions that extends the view with other ways to compare these two backtests.

- OO code solution.
- PHP 7.1+ syntax.
- For simplicity ignore start-end dates of the backtests.
- Create two sparklines with 100 points, representative of each backtest result.
